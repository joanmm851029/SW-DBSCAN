The SW-DBCSAN algorithm is used for the task division in forest fire fighting.
dataprocess.py is used for data preprocessing. DBSCAN -nodataprocess.py implements forest fire suppression task partitioning based on the SW-DBSCAN algorithm.
Run dataprocess.py first, followed by DBSCAN -nodataprocess.py.
The data folder contains coordinate files for all fire lines. Simply rename the corresponding file to coordinates.txt (e.g., rename coordinates-1559.txt to coordinates.txt). After renaming, copy the file to the source directory.
